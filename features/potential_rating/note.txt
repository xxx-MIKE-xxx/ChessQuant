After we find the highest potential ranting - we also find out the best tilt
threshold - we can use it for the users personalized tilt optimal signal -
eg. turn this scale tilt - 0-1 to play / stop taking stop as the most optimal 
tilt threshold. Another thing is number of warmup games that maximise ranking
we find a personalized number of games that gives highest ranking and we use
this info to personalize warmup. We can just eliminate as many games as we want
because we only eliminate from 'fields' or sections of a chess session that 
we know we can improve - which right now are lowering the true rating. Goal:
to find a suitable algorithm for finding a warmup period specific to each 
session
